# ArLet â€” Discord bot for ease of use arweave and smart contracts! | 1500+ guilds

Developer: Alexcitten#0001, if you have any ideas for functionality, or questions - feel free to write<br>
Code provided for study.

I am planning to add real time view of various metrics, more smart contracts in the future, and a command to search and view desired information from Arweave sites, for example - ArWiki.<br><br>
UPD: I don't have a valid contract right now Another Money. This bot was supposed to support [Another Money](https://another.money), so a lot of it remains in the code, and now I don't really want to change it.
