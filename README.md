# ArLet — Discord Bot | 1450+ guilds

This unusual Discord-bot is created for the Arweave Community, for ease of transactions of AR token and smart contracts based on Arweave (only ArDrive is now available) and other interactions, creating a semi-cold arweave wallet, balance view

This is far from all the functionality, because the bot was planned to be originally with extensive functionality, support for Bitcoin, Cosmos(ATOM), [HNS](https://hsd-dev.org/), and so on, also provide cryptocurrency electronic commerce: buying, selling, and bidding on any cryptogood at Opensea API (and we already have the key to the API)

The purpose of the ArLet in Discord — open a new sphere of functionality with a similar implementation that we plan (tip.cc, you are cool, do not worry, we will have something else) with such cryptocurrencies and smart contracts and simplify the discord users with these cryptocurrencies and tokens.
As you know, the current functionality is far from the end! We want to go far as we can.

## Getting Started

This code is provided for study, and it is sitting right now in the present ArLet. You can take it, but please make it unique, with a significant modification, let's develop this sphere in the bots together! Everyone is already tired of these bots of the same type with userinfo command, kick and commands of receiving pictures of funny cats, let's make useful and interesting bots, from which we at least get a donate of 10$, buy something, exchange it for the fact that it costs 15$, then 20$, and so, until there is a large amount, we will buy several businesses, create a monopoly... Let's better buy pistachios.

## In plans

* Track various metrics in real time.
* Finding the right information on [ArWiki](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en)
* Support for BTC, [HNS](https://hsd-dev.org/), Cosmos(ATOM) and similar cryptocurrencies
